# ðŸŒ³ Tree Species Classification
This project aims to classify different species of trees from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with **EfficientNet**. A simple and interactive **Streamlit** web app has been developed to allow users to upload an image and get real-time predictions.
